# random-picture-php-script
A quick & dirty PHP script to mimic very basic unsplash.it functionality with your own folder with pictures. It's based on [this](https://www.dyn-web.com/code/random-image-php/), but adapted to serve a native picture file + the ability to avoid throwing the same picture again for the next 30 pictures.

Based on requester IP, images can be selected from different folders.
